# openclawrl

Reproduction of [OpenClaw-RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.10165)'s personal-agent experiment as a Reef weight-training recipe. OpenClaw-RL trains an agent from its ordinary usage: each turn is scored by what the user did next, a follow-up that moves on counts as acceptance and a complaint as rejection, and the policy updates while it keeps serving. The agent uses Reef as its inference endpoint and sends no training report; its harness should stamp a stable, conversation-unique `x-reef-tag-session` value, while the processor can fall back to matching extending transcripts. The package holds the method, and the simulated-student experiment around it lives in [examples/openclawrl](examples/openclawrl/README.md).

- Paper: [arXiv:2603.10165](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.10165)
- Pins: `slime` pinned to `THUDM/slime@41014d1f29e201137fdffce737bb8bac65bc5219` (via `pyproject.toml` `dependency-groups.runtime`); the completed run used `Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507` as the policy and PRM, `Qwen3-32B` as the student, and `hermes-agent@b6bcb3e791c673e63974029bbab40cc9326803ff` (see the example Dockerfiles), over a 72-session GSM8K homework stream
- Claim scope: one recorded run over the first 36 sessions of the stream. The run reached the paper's adaptation criterion, three passed sessions in a row, at session 14, and the bold and list rates fall over the run. One student persona, one task family; this is an adaptation result, not a benchmark-wide reproduction.

## Where the rest is documented

[The openclawrl recipe page](../../docs/user-guide/recipes/openclawrl.rst) covers configuration and the serving stack, and the [example README](examples/openclawrl/README.md) records implementation details, the stream protocol, and the recorded run.
