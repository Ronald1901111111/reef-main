    """Single-Rollout Asynchronous Optimization (arXiv:2607.07508) on reef.

    SAO is asynchronous by construction here: with ``batch_size=1`` the
    dispatcher runs one training step per accepted rollout, so a rollout enters
    training the moment its score arrives, with no comparison group or
    slowest-sample barrier. The DIS ratio needs the rollout log-probabilities as
    its behaviour proxy, so SAO requires an inference backend that attaches
    engine-native tensors (``reef.inference_backend_factory``); reef never
    re-tokenizes a rollout to reconstruct them.

    Objective settings such as the clipping bounds, actor/critic cadence, and GAE
    parameters belong to the training backend. For Slime they are configured by
    ``training.options``; this recipe only owns Reef-side batching and
    checkpoint cadence.

    ``batch_size`` must equal the Slime driver's ``--global-batch-size``: each
    rollout sample is its own DP unit.
