    Single-Rollout Asynchronous Optimization ships each completed rollout on

    default ``batch_size=1`` the dispatcher trains once per accepted rollout, so
    a rollout enters training the moment its score arrives.

    SAO reuses ``PolicySample`` / ``PolicyBatch`` but fills the ``action_mask``
    (for skip-observation GAE) and ``rollout_created_at`` (for queue age) that
    the group-relative processors leave at their defaults. Nothing upstream
    validates a single-inference sample, so ``judge`` is where a malformed
    rollout is dropped as terminal rather than failing a training step: the
    Slime bridge's tensor contract, plus SAO's own rule that the action mask
    lines up with the loss mask.
