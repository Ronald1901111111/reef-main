You are solving FrontierCS algorithmic problem 0: Polyomino Packing.

Write a self-contained C++17 program that reads one instance from stdin and writes
one placement to stdout.

Input:
- The first line contains n, the number of polyominoes.
- For each polyomino i, one line contains k_i, followed by k_i lines of integer
  cell coordinates x y in the polyomino local frame.
- Each polyomino has 1 to 10 cells, is 4-connected, and coordinates may be negative.

Output:
- First line: two integers W H for the chosen board.
- Then exactly n lines, one per input polyomino, each with X Y R F.
- X Y is the integer translation.
- R is one of 0, 1, 2, 3 and means clockwise rotation by R * 90 degrees.
- F is 0 or 1. If F=1, reflect across the y-axis before applying the rotation.

Validity:
- Apply transforms in this order: optional reflection, rotation, translation.
- Every transformed cell must satisfy 0 <= x < W and 0 <= y < H.
- No two transformed cells may overlap.
- Invalid output, crashes, or timeouts receive zero score.

Objective:
- Maximize the FrontierCS score by minimizing packing area W * H across the benchmark cases.
- Ties favor smaller H, then smaller W.
- Solutions are compiled with g++ -std=c++17 -O2 and evaluated by FrontierCS/go-judge.
