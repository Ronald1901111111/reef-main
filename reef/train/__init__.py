"""Training domain: the loop, and the pluggable backends that execute it.

One package, mirroring how a well-scoped training subsystem is usually
organized: a coordinator (:class:`Trainer`) that turns raw records into
reserved, typed batches (``processors/``, ``reef.core.batches``), the recipe's candidate
evaluation that gates each produced update (``evaluation/``), and one
:class:`TrainingBackend` lifecycle. Harness evolution implements it directly;
Weight recipes bind any TrainingRuntime through ``RuntimeTrainingBackend``. The GPU stack
is reached by full path so importing ``reef.train`` itself stays light.

``algos/`` turns a reserved batch into a ``StepSignal`` — the same
computation no matter which backend executes it — and its ``StepScheduling``
says how the runtime cuts one batch into optimizer steps. ``evaluation/`` is
the recipe's candidate gate; ``Trainer`` runs it between prepare and settle.

The package does not import recipes or service assembly. ``CordisRecipe``
lives in ``reef.recipe.cordis``; the Slime process entrypoint lives in
``reef.service.slime_driver``.

Tests and deployment configuration stay at repository level, never inside an
integration subtree: ``tests/slime_backend/`` for runtime internals,
``tests/plugin_contracts/`` for package boundaries, ``tests/reef_service/``
for service-facing contracts, with runnable examples owned by their method
packages.
