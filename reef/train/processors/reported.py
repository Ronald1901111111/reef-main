"""The reported-feedback processor and shared building blocks.

:class:`ReportedFeedbackProcessor` owns the exactly-once state that pairs asynchronously
arriving inference and report records. Every structure it keeps answers one
hard requirement of continual serving — delete any one and a documented
failure returns:

* dedup (``_seen_reports``) — exactly-once under client retries and crash
  replay;
* the waiting index — reports legally arrive before the inference records
  they reference;
* trained-source refusal — a rollout an acknowledged batch consumed must
  never train twice, whatever the replay order;
* groups and slots — grouped recipes need a complete-set barrier and
  retry-safe coordinates;
* recomputed retention — the store deletes records, so what is safe to
  delete must be answerable at any moment, never latched at event time.

Retention is derived, never authored per recipe: live reports and their
references are protected, consumed and terminal records are releasable, and a
source is releasable when a terminal report owns it (or training consumed it)
and no live report still claims it.  That releasable-source set is recomputed
from live state on every read — never latched at event time — so a late retry
re-claims a not-yet-compacted source, and a claimant's later death frees the
source it blocked.
