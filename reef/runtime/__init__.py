"""Runtime contracts and adapters for external model services.

Every request needs an ``InferenceRuntime`` — it is what ``service/`` calls
to answer with the provider's API — which is why the package belongs to
serving even though ``train/`` also drives it for recipes that train.
``TrainingRuntime`` extends it with the durable candidate lifecycle:
candidate training exports a checkpoint without changing serving, and Reef
evaluates it before choosing activation or rejection.

``model_config.ModelConfig`` is the concrete, in-memory model selection shared
by a scenario and its recipe. It has no file paths or persistence behavior.

Training batches and candidate evaluation contracts come from ``reef.core``.
This package never imports ``reef.train``.

Boundaries this package holds:

- No concrete training backend is imported here. Backends implement
  ``TrainingGroupHandle`` and ``ExecutorTrainingRuntime`` drives only the
  handle; ``reef.train.slime`` never appears at module scope.
- Malformed results and missing capabilities surface as contract errors
  (``RuntimeContractError``, ``TrainingRuntimeError``), never as silent fallbacks.
  The default ``restore_checkpoint`` refuses rather than moving the artifact
  head under an engine that kept newer weights.
- Surfaces see runtimes only structurally, through ``ServingRuntime`` and
  ``WeightRuntime`` in ``surface/base.py``; nothing in ``surface/`` imports
  this package.

Adding a runtime kind: subclass ``RuntimeFactory``, set its ``kind``, and
decorate the class with ``@register_runtime_kind`` in a module imported at
boot. Or set the config ``type`` to a dotted ``package.module:factory_name``
reference, which ``runtime_factory_for`` imports on resolution.
