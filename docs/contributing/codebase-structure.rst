Codebase structure
==================

This page says which package should own a change.

--------------------

``reef/`` holds every shared mechanism, including the harness evolution engine
at ``reef/train/cordis_backend/``. The built-in Reefine recipe lives under
``reef/recipe/reefine/``. Paper-backed methods live in separate
packages under ``recipes/`` (``sao``, ``tttd``, ``openclawrl``, ``skillclaw``)
with that method's recipe, processor, step preparer, and, for weight methods,
the ``slime/`` subpackage only the training plane imports. Nothing under
``reef/`` imports a method package.

Reef is organized around an application kernel and three capability domains,
not a strict stack of top-level packages. The arrows below show the primary
composition and use paths; they are not an exhaustive Python import graph:

       Kernel -. telemetry .-> Observability
       ServingAdapters & EvolutionAdapters & StateAdapters --> Core

Method packages provide policy through ``reef/recipe`` and may bind
``reef/train`` machinery directly. HTTP and CLI entrypoints compose Reef
through ``reef/service``; the transport-free dispatcher and scenario aggregate
coordinate serving, evolution, and state. ``reef/service`` also imports
``reef/artifact`` directly to stream artifact bytes.

Concrete integrations may depend on shared contracts; shared contracts never
import a concrete integration.

Package import direction
------------------------

Imports between the top-level Reef packages form a directed acyclic graph.
``tests/reef_service/test_dependency_boundaries.py`` scans every Python file,
including relative imports and imports inside functions. Importing the root
``reef`` facade from an internal package also counts as a dependency; internal
code imports the owning module directly.

The following table records direct package dependencies (excluding each
package's own submodules and third-party libraries):

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Package
     - Imports
   * - ``core``
     - None
   * - ``storage``, ``artifact``, ``observability``
     - ``core``
   * - ``surface``
     - ``artifact``, ``core``
   * - ``runtime``
     - ``surface``, ``artifact``, ``core``
   * - ``harness``
     - ``runtime``, ``core``
   * - ``train``
     - ``harness``, ``runtime``, ``surface``, ``artifact``, ``storage``, ``observability``, ``core``
   * - ``recipe``
     - ``train``, ``harness``, ``runtime``, ``surface``, ``storage``, ``observability``, ``core``
   * - ``scenario``
     - ``recipe``, ``train``, ``runtime``, ``surface``, ``artifact``, ``storage``, ``observability``, ``core``
   * - ``dispatcher``
     - ``scenario``, ``recipe``, ``train``, ``harness``, ``runtime``, ``artifact``, ``storage``, ``observability``, ``core``
   * - ``service``
     - ``dispatcher``, ``scenario``, ``recipe``, ``train``, ``harness``, ``runtime``, ``surface``, ``artifact``, ``storage``, ``observability``, ``core``
   * - ``cli``
     - ``service``, ``core``

Shared batches and candidate evaluation contracts live in ``core/batches.py``
and ``core/evaluation.py``. Request requirements and their release-chain
interpretation live in ``core/requirements.py``. Storage owns commit record
encoding; scenario owns commit ordering and recovery. Artifact admission lives
with surface contracts, while checkpoint cadence is recipe policy.
``recipe/cordis.py`` assembles the harness training backend, and
``service/slime_driver.py`` starts the optional Slime process.

The extension points those packages expose are in `Python API
<../reference/python-api.rst>`__.


- Is it a value or error needed by unrelated layers without behavior attached?
  Put it in ``reef/core/``.
- Does it own scenario state, commit ordering, recovery, or rollback? Put it in
  ``reef/scenario/``. ``reef/storage/commits.py`` defines the persisted ``CommitRecord`` and
  ``RecordProgress`` values without storage behavior. Checkpoint recovery uses
  the same ``CommitRecord`` type; initial registration has no commit.
  ``reef/storage/scenario.py`` defines the ``ScenarioStore`` and ``ScenarioStorage``
  abstract bases. ``storage/commits.py`` also encodes artifact metadata and decodes existing
  checkpoint metadata into registration information and a ``CommitRecord``.
  ``ScenarioFactory`` receives the storage service from deployment assembly
  and handles registration, release selection, and recovery. It opens a
  session, restores committed artifacts, builds the trainer, replays records,
  and returns a complete ``Scenario``; failure closes its owned resources. ``committer.py`` owns writes and retry ordering;
  ``releases.py`` owns release and artifact queries under the same publication
  lock. ``history.py`` pages retained records and commits. ``registry.py`` owns
  loaded instances, model configuration caching, updates, and scenario
  archival coordination. Recipes, scenarios, and the factory use the concrete
  ``ModelConfig`` in ``reef/runtime/model_config.py``. The factory receives
  one configuration per creation or recovery; it owns no configuration cache.
  The registry calls ``reef/storage/model_config.py`` functions directly for
  the fixed local JSON files. This is its only storage implementation import:
  records and commits still use an injected ``ScenarioStorage``.
  ``Dispatcher`` calls the storage service directly for retention and closes
  it after closing the loaded scenarios. It never imports or chooses a
  concrete record backend.
- Does it define shared record operations or retention limits? Put the contract
  or value in ``reef/storage/records.py``. It defines the ``RecordStore`` abstract base
  without importing scenario coordination, training, or concrete adapters.
  ``ScenarioStore`` combines a ``RecordStore`` with committed scenario state;
  ``ScenarioStorage`` owns archival and retention.
- Does it implement storage? Put it in ``reef/storage/``. ``sql_records.py``
  shares SQL record and retention operations; ``sqlite.py`` supplies SQLite
  schema, connections, transactions, and file maintenance. ``postgres.py`` supplies
  PostgreSQL tables, pooled transactions, and retention. ``commit_log.py`` owns
  the JSONL ``CommitLog`` and ``CommitLogScenarioStore``, which accepts any
  ``RecordStore``. ``sqlite.py`` and ``postgres.py`` assemble their respective
  scenario storage services against the interfaces in ``scenario.py``.
  Storage implementations depend on domain contracts, never the reverse.
- Does it persist or materialize versioned bytes? Put it in
  ``reef/artifact/``. If it decides how consumers activate those bytes, put
  that behavior in ``reef/surface/`` instead.
- Does it define a backend-neutral model-service contract? Put it in
  ``reef/runtime/``. Put implementation tied to a concrete training stack in
  its own ``reef/train/<integration>/`` subtree.
  ``reef/train/cordis_backend/`` is the general harness evolution engine;
  the shared composition engine lives in ``reef/harness/compose/``. It derives
  from cordis 4.0.0-rc.8; see ``reef/harness/compose/UPSTREAM.md``. ``reef/train/slime_backend/`` is the
  weights counterpart.
- Does it turn records and feedback into a batch or step signal? Put it in
  ``reef/train/processors/`` or ``reef/train/algos/``. A recipe selects and
  binds that machinery; it should not reimplement it.
- Is it HTTP-specific? Keep the aiohttp adapter in ``reef/service/routes/``
  and put transport-independent behavior in a service or domain object.
- Does it orchestrate a benchmark, task, grader, or external environment?
  Keep it under ``recipes/<name>/examples/`` or in the external harness.

Repository-level homes
----------------------

Code for a concrete training integration lives together under
``reef/train/<integration>/``, but its surrounding files remain at repository
level:

- internal integration tests in ``tests/<integration>/``;
- import and packaging contracts in ``tests/plugin_contracts/``;
- service-facing contracts in ``tests/reef_service/``;
- the learn-nothing deployment stacks, and the smallest example around them, in
  ``recipes/basic/``;
- configuration for one runnable deployment under ``recipes/<name>/examples/``;
- container and environment setup under ``docker/``; and
- Python dependencies, package data, and plugin entry points in
  ``pyproject.toml``.

Do not copy third-party source into an integration subtree. Pin or declare the
dependency in ``pyproject.toml`` and keep Reef-owned adapters local to the
integration.

Where the detailed rules live
-----------------------------

Each package's ``__init__`` docstring states the boundaries it holds and
how to extend it; there are no READMEs under ``reef/``. Design pages for the
two packages that need more than a docstring are `Surfaces
<../developer-guide/surface.rst>`__ and `Processors
<../developer-guide/processors.rst>`__; the extension points every package
exposes are in `Python API <../reference/python-api.rst>`__, and the public
harness wire contract is `HTTP API <../reference/http-api.rst>`__. The
`top-level README <../../README.md>`__ shows how the cookbook methods sit
beside ``reef/``.

``reef/train/cordis_backend/`` is the general harness evolution engine; the
shared composition engine derives from cordis 4.0.0-rc.8 with the conformance
map in ``reef/harness/compose/UPSTREAM.md``. ``reef/train/slime_backend/`` is the weights
counterpart.

Adding a new subpackage under ``reef/`` or a new method under ``recipes/``
requires an RFC that states which layer owns the behavior.


Deployment modules
------------------

``reef/service/deploy/`` separates configuration input from process startup:

* ``config_utils.py`` reads YAML, expands environment/config references and locates
  recipe source packages. It does not download models or validate process graphs.
* ``service_config.py`` declares shared HTTP, storage and runtime fields and
  converts effective values into ``ServiceConfig`` for app assembly.
* ``deployment_config.py`` declares ``DeploymentConfig`` defaults, loads selected
  recipe/runtime declarations, translates the versioned public layout and
  validates component values.
* ``cli.py`` builds help and applies dotted command-line overrides before shared
  type conversion. CLI values take precedence over YAML.
* ``inference.py`` assembles provider or local inference processes and resolves
  model snapshots; ``training.py`` selects training deployment definitions and
  assembles the training dependencies and HTTP process.
* ``execution.py`` validates process definitions and dependency order and selects
  executors. ``process.py`` owns worker processes; ``guard.py`` cleans up a remote
  process group when its Ray owner disappears.
* ``orchestrator.py`` coordinates configuration resolution, launch, readiness,
  supervision and shutdown, including the internal HTTP child entrypoint.

Shared parsing types come directly from ``reef.core.config``. Native backend
argument encoding comes from ``reef.runtime.executor.arguments``. The package
exports in ``reef.service.deploy`` remain the entrypoints for app assembly and
launching; internal module names are not a compatibility API.
