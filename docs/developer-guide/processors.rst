Processors
==========

A processor is a scenario's batch builder: records in, one typed training
batch out, plus the answer to what the record store may delete. This page
explains the two engines a recipe can subclass, what each owns, and the path a
record takes to a batch.

.. page::
   :for: recipe authors choosing an engine, and anyone reading ``reef/train/processors/``
   :needs: the processor hooks from `Python API <../reference/python-api.rst#processor>`__
   :outcome: which engine a method needs, what it writes, and what it never writes

The contract
------------

The trainer drives four mutating methods on its own thread, under its lock;
none may block:

- ``ingest(record)``: one record arrives;
- ``ready()``: is a batch available;
- ``build_batch()``: produce it (the trainer validates it against ``output_schema``);
- ``acknowledge(batch_id)``: the training step consumed that batch; returns
  the consumed record ids, which the commit record persists so recovery never
  re-ingests them.

The processor also controls retention. The trainer reads
``retention_decision()`` (protected vs releasable ids) and reports deletions
back through ``compaction_applied()``.
Nothing numeric lives here. Advantages and the loss family are the step
preparer's. The read-only ``status()`` hook is empty by default; a processor
uses it only when a terminal outcome cannot become a batch and an external
runner must stop waiting (TTTD reports a complete mixed-artifact step as an
invariant failure).

``DataProcessor`` in ``base.py`` is concrete on purpose: bare, it is the
no-update default that ingests for audit and never becomes ready. Recipes
can implement their own lifecycle or reuse one of the feedback engines below.

Explicit manual training
------------------------

``training_mode`` is an attribute of each ``DataProcessor``. The recipe passes
its initial value through ``Trainer.build`` and ``ProcessorContext``; it
defaults to ``auto``. Ingestion, acknowledgement, retention and compaction use
the same methods and buffers in every mode. ``GET /reef/status`` reports
``pending_instructions`` as the processor's ``buffered_requests`` plus the
instructions still unread in storage.

The shared batching cycle waits for ``batch_size`` units in ``auto``, for a
queued TRAIN instruction in ``manual``, and for either in ``hybrid``, where a
queued instruction goes first. A processor that takes instructions declares
``supported_training_modes = frozenset({"auto", "manual", "hybrid"})`` and
implements one assembly hook:

.. code:: python

   def make_training_batch(self, batch_number, request):
       if request is not None and self.training_mode == "manual":
           # Manual runs the instruction alone; harness needs no samples.
           self._pending_units = ()
           return TraceBatch(request.id, ())
       # Hybrid hands the instruction the units an automatic batch would take.
       return self._make_pending(batch_number)

This example extends the reported-feedback engine. ``request`` is a
``TrainingRequest`` in ``manual`` and ``hybrid`` when an instruction is queued
and ``None`` for an automatic batch. The base class attaches the instruction
to ``batch.request`` and replaces the hook's own batch id with
``<scenario>:instruction:<request id>``, the oldest instruction first, one
per step. ``_consume_pending`` releases the selected data; shared
acknowledgement also consumes the instruction. A processor that needs other
inputs for an instruction selects them in the hook or extends the shared
``ready`` predicate. Batch construction must not call models or perform
training.

Processors receive TRAIN records by including ``RequestType.TRAIN`` in
``required_request_types`` and forwarding those records to ``super().ingest``.
The base class queues them FIFO regardless of the selected mode; ``auto``
leaves the queue for a mode that takes it. Data ingestion continues normally
in manual mode, so changing to auto or hybrid can batch data already collected;
the reported-feedback engine holds at most four batches of units in manual
mode and releases the oldest beyond that with a warning, at the switch and
as reports arrive. Custom retention
implementations must preserve queued instructions and release consumed ones,
as the reported-feedback engine does.

Unsupported modes, or instruction assembly without an implementation, raise
``NotImplementedError``. An invalid mode name raises ``ValueError``.
The default automatic assembly keeps the existing ``_make_pending`` hook;
automatic processors and computed-feedback ``ingest`` implementations need no
mode-specific lifecycle methods or additional processor class.

Changing training mode
----------------------

``POST /reef/scenarios/{scenario}/update`` selects ``auto``, ``manual`` or
``hybrid`` on the existing processor. The trainer serializes selection with
ingestion and reservation. A reserved batch stays unchanged and acknowledgement
consumes its actual contents, independently of subsequent mode changes.

Buffered data and queued instructions stay on the same instance. The selector
is runtime state: a scenario reload after a failed step keeps the selected
mode, and a service restart starts from the recipe's configured mode.

The two feedback paths
----------------------

One question picks the engine: **does feedback arrive in a report, or must the
method compute it?**

+-----------------+---------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
|                 | reported: ``ReportedFeedbackProcessor``     | computed: ``ComputedFeedbackProcessor``            |
+=================+=============================================+====================================================+
| feedback        | reports referencing inference records       | signal mined from the traffic itself               |
| arrives as      |                                             |                                                    |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| ``judge`` is    | a plain method                              | an ``async def``                                   |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+

|                 |                                             | ``ingest`` dispatches                              |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| so it may       | only decide on data already in hand         | call models and take minutes                       |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+

Why there are two
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Everything else, including the ``async``, follows from that one question.

A report *arrives knowing what it judges*: it names its inference records.
The decision is then a comparison on data already in hand: cheap,
synchronous, and possible the moment the last referenced record lands. What
it costs is bookkeeping about the reference: an index of reports waiting on
inferences that have not arrived, ownership of the records a report claims,
dedup for a grader that retries its POST, and a barrier for recipes whose
unit is a whole group.

A computed-feedback recipe has no report. Its signal does not exist until
later traffic completes an earlier record, and judging it calls a model.
Judgment can take seconds or minutes, which would stall serving if it ran on
the trainer's thread. It moves to a worker instead, with different
bookkeeping: which records still wait, a TTL for the ones whose completion
never comes, and absorption for judgments that land without a record to
trigger them.

Neither set follows from ``async``. Making the reported judge asynchronous
would make timing uniform while keeping every structure above, and would make
every reported recipe's readiness eventually consistent and expose it to
losing an in-flight judgment on a crash, an exposure only the computed path
carries today. The engines differ because the questions differ. What they
share (hold a pending batch, be ready while it exists or once enough units
are held, and release what it consumed) is defined once in ``base.py``. Each
engine fills in ``_ready_count``, ``_make_pending``, and ``_consume_pending``.

What a recipe writes
--------------------

**Reported feedback:** ``judge``, ``make_batch``, ``decide_group`` when it
groups, plus the class attributes ``output_schema``, ``exclusive_sources``,
``ordered_groups``.

**Computed feedback:** In ``ingest``, the correlation *is* the method. It uses
the engine's ``catch_up`` / ``dispatch`` / ``track`` / ``retire`` verbs, as
well as ``judge``, ``make_sample``, ``make_batch``, and ``expire`` for tracked
records that time out.

Neither tier contains retention, lifecycle, or recovery code.

A record's path to a batch
--------------------------

.. code:: text

   reported report ─ingest─► judge(context) ─TRAIN─► candidate ─[decide_group]─► make_batch ─► batch ─ack─► released
                               │ WAIT  parked in the waiting index; re-judged when the last referenced inference lands
                               └ NEVER terminal now; the report and the sources it owns become releasable

   computed record ─ingest─► track ──(a later record completes it)──► dispatch ─► judge (async, on the worker)
                                                                                        │
                               batch ◄─ make_batch ◄─ candidate ◄─ make_sample ◄────────┘
                                                           └ None ─► retire: terminal, releasable

Where a processor lives
-----------------------

Every file under ``reef/train/processors/`` is framework: ``base``,
``reported``, ``computed``, and ``common`` (shared report readers and sample
builders). A method that owns its judgment writes
``recipes/<name>/processor.py``, and that file should show its data flow from
top to bottom. A method that delegates to an engine backend writes none: the
backend owns its concrete processor (``reef/train/cordis_backend/processor.py``)
and wires it in its ``build``, which is why ``recipes/skillclaw/`` ships no
processor file. Machinery beyond that file's job sits beside it as
modules named by concern (``recipes/openclawrl/``: ``sessions``, ``turns``,
``prm``), never in the processor file and never in a ``utils`` grab-bag.

Each structure the engines keep answers one requirement of continual
serving; delete one and a documented failure returns. The list for the
reported engine, naming the attribute each requirement forces, is in the
module docstring of ``reported.py``; the computed engine names its per-state
structures on ``ComputedFeedbackProcessor`` itself.
